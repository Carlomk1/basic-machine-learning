# About The Project
In this project, the basic methods & techniques of machine learning and predictive modeling are applied with the use of R.

The aim is to apply the theory using a practical example in order to get to know and understand the basic techniques. 
For the theoretical basics, the literature “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R” by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie & R. Tibshirani was used.
Available under this [link](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1418-1).

# Project idea
For the concrete application of the theory, the following models were tested using a data set:

1. Explorative data analysis
2. Linear model
3. Generalized linear model with family set toPoisson 
4. Generalized linear model with family set to binomial
5. Generalized additive model
6. Basic neural network 
7. Support vector machine

The aim here was to create models for previously defined research questions and to use them for the first time.
The research questions therefore are:

1. How does the budget, the genres and the popularity influence the revenue of a film?
2. How do various factors influence the number of votes/ratings a movie receives?
3. Which factors contribute a movie achieving a return on investment (ROI) of at least 150%?
4. How do various factors influence the financial performance of films?
5. Can we create a model that can reliably predict popularity?
6. Is it possible to classify films on the basis of certain characteristics to decide whethera movie can achieve financial success?


# Data Sources
The data set used was the publicly available TMBD Movie Dataset, available at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/successikuku/tmbd-movie-dataset/data) via kaggle.
